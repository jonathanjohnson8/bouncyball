# bouncyball
An animation of sorts, featuring a blue, bouncing ball.

The fundamentals developed in this example include:

Decomposition:

Four functions were created, where each of the four fucntions represents a condition to prevent the ball from
disappearing off the screen.

Life-Like Movement:

We had to think of the movement of the ball once it hits a wall. In order to do this, we decided to change
the ball's x or y direction depending on the wall it hit(corresponding to basic conceptions of physics).
